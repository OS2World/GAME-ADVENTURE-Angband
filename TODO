- Add support for gamma correction to the DOS version.
- Move various information to external files (spells, items that can be
  bought in stores).
- Add player ghosts.
- Equipment slots should be configurable for every player race.
- Gender selection should be done after selecting the player race (for
  races with non-standard genders).
- Add support for dungeon displays with sizes different than 66x22
  (big-screen).  This requires changing the detection spells to a circular
  area of effect.  Running should be interrupted when the player leaves
  the area of the last trap detection spell ("disturb_panel").
- Allow stacking of rods, wands, and staves with different charges.
- Add a random name generator for player names.
- Add support for automatically numbering characters ("Rocky IV").
- Finish the GTK+ port, maybe write a qt version.
- Improve the command-line option usage display.
- Try to open the file handles for score and savefiles at startup and
  then drop all permissions.
- Improve the scorefile format.
- Add color support to the show_file() function.
- Find a better way for saving options than appending to *.prf files.
- Allow multiple pvals per object.
- Add message compression "You tunnel into the granite wall. <5x>"
- Split long lines in the message recall.
- The ANSI-C standard reserves some prefixes for external names like "str".
  Make sure that Angband doesn't use them.
- Rewrite the debug-mode object flag display so that it doesn't require
  manual changes for every new flag.
- Use sizeof(buffer) instead of using the numeric size. The compiler is
  won't forget to update the number when the size of the buffer changes.
- Write helper functions for accessing items on the floor so that handling
  floor stacks is less cumbersome.
- Fix the "vinfo_type" hack in cave.c.
- Unify line of sight and projection paths.
- Make sure that signed integers aren't bit-shifted.
- Use enumerations instead of #defines when possible.
- Move spaces at the end of description lines in monster.txt to the
  beginning of the next line.
- Add optional support for the metric system.
- Add a main-net.c modules that sends/receives term-updates via TCP/IP.
  This allows slim clients on machines where Angband isn't available.
  The clients could be written in almost any programming language and
  have minimal hardware requirements.
- Adjust the Unix/Linux installation for full compliance with the
  Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.
- Move the elemental damage types that are ignored by items to object.txt.
- Make the filenames in src/ more meaningful.
- Add reference counting for the "quarks" (inscriptions).
- Add a compile-time option that prevents the player from saving pref-files,
  character dumps, and screenshots.
- "Panic saves" shouldn't overwrite normal savefiles.
- Replace the maximize mode option with a "half-maximized" mode.
- Properly integrate the transparency code into the game.
- Simplify the FREE() and KILL() macros.
